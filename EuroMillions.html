    <em>The overall odds of winning a prize are 1 in 13.</em>
    <p>The percentage allocated to the jackpot is adjusted from 50% to 42% after five
        draws in a rollover series. The difference of 8% is allocated to a reserve fund to
        ensure the minimum jackpot can always be paid.</p>
    <p>The remaining 1% of the prize fund is allocated to a reserve Booster Fund to
        ensure the minimum jackpot can always be paid. Occasionally a special jackpot
        draw is held using surplus funds from the Booster Funds.</p>
    <p>The underlying lottery is conducted on a pari-mutuel lottery basis, how much
        you win depends on the number of winning tickets in that same tier as well as
        the number of tickets sold in the particular underlying lottery draw.</p>
    <p>Only one prize per game can be won in each draw, if a game qualifies as a
        winner across more than one prize category than the highest prize will be paid
        to the winning player.</p>

        maximum of five draws, if there is no winner in the fifth draw the jackpot is paid
        out to lower prize tiers. Each time the jackpot cap is reached and paid out, the
        jackpot cap increases by €10 million for the next cycle, this method can continue
        to a maximum of €250 million.</p>
