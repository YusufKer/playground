    <em>The overall odds of winning a prize are 1 in 6.6.</em>
    <p>*The percentage shown for prize tiers 1 through to 4, is the percentage of the
        ‘Estimated Prize Fund’ after the value of Prize Tiers 5, 6 and 7 have been
        deducted.</p>
    <p>The underlying lottery is conducted on a pari-mutuel lottery basis, how much
        you win depends on the number of winning tickets in that same tier as well as
        the number of tickets sold in the particular underlying lottery draw. With the</p>
    <p>exception of the ‘3 Numbers’, ‘2 Numbers + Bonus Ball’ and ‘2 Numbers’ prize
        categories (Prize Tiers 5, 6 and 7) which are fixed prizes.</p>
    <p>Only one prize per game can be won in each draw, if a game qualifies as a
        winner across more than one prize category than the highest prize will be paid
        to the winning player.</p>
    <p>The Guaranteed Prize Draw is a supplementary game where one ticket holder in
        the underlying lottery will win CA$1 million in each Canadian Lotto 6/49 draw. A
        player receives one ten-digit code for the Guaranteed Prize Draw for each game
        purchased in the particular draw. If the code matches the code drawn the player
        wins the CA$1 million prize.</p>
