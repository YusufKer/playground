<h2><img src="/site/themes/online-lottos/images/lotto_logo_assets/logo_euro-millions_150.png" alt=""> EuroMillions Game Rules</h2>
<p>EuroMillions is a lottery played across several European countries. Players are required to select 5 main numbers, from 1 to 50 and two ‘Lucky Star’ numbers from an additional pool of 1 to 12. During the draw process, 5 random main numbers are drawn and 2 random Lucky Stars are drawn. The draw takes place twice each week, on Tuesdays and Fridays in Paris.
</p>
<p>The minimum jackpot is €17 million (approximately AUD$25 million). When the jackpot is not won, the jackpot rolls over to the next draw. The jackpot increases each draw where it’s not won, until it reaches the EuroMillions jackpot cap of €220 million (approximately AUD$340 million). When the cap is reached, if it is not then won for 5 draws, the jackpot prize rolls down to the next division with a winner.
</p>
<p>Each time the jackpot cap is reached, and subsequently won, it will increase by €10 million (approximately AUD$15 million) for the next cycle. The same mechanism will be applied until the jackpot cap reaches €250 million (approximately AUD$385 million).
