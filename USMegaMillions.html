        <h3>Jackpot Payout</h3>
        <p>The jackpot prize in the underlying lottery is on a pari-mutuel basis, how much
            you win depends on the number of winning tickets in that same tier as well as
            the number of tickets sold in a particular draw.
            Jackpot winners can elect to receive their prize as an annuity or a lump-sum
            payment.</p>
