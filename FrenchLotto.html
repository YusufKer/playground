    <p>The overall odds of winning a prize are 1 in 5.99.</p>
    <p>*The percentage shown for prize tiers 2 through to 8, is the percentage of the
        ‘Estimated Prize Fund’ after the value of Prize Tiers 1, 9 and 10 have been
        deducted.</p>
    <p>The underlying lottery is conducted on a pari-mutuel lottery basis, how much
        you win depends on the number of winning tickets in that same tier as well as
        the number of tickets sold in the particular underlying lottery draw. With the
        exception of the ‘1 Number + Chance Number’ and ‘Chance Number’ prize
        categories (Prize Tiers 9 and 10) which are fixed prizes.</p>
    <p>Only one prize per game can be won in each draw, if a game qualifies as a
        winner across more than one prize category than the highest prize will be paid
        to the winning player.</p>

        (AEST).</p>

<div>
    <h3>Jackpot Rollover</h3>
