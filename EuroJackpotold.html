<p>The Eurojackpot is a lottery played by participants from selected European countries. Players must select 5 main numbers from a pool of 1 to 50. Two ‘Euro’ numbers from a second pool of 1 to 10 must also be selected. The winning numbers are then drawn at random in Helsinki, Finland each Friday (Helsinki time). The minimum jackpot is €10 million (approximately AUD$17 million). When it’s not won, it grows each draw until it’s either won, or reaches a maximum of €90 million (approximately AUD $140 million).If it’s not reached after 12 consecutive rollover draws any money that would normally go towards increasing the jackpot prize for the next draw will instead go to the second division.
