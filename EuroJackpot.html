    <em>The overall odds of winning a prize are 1 in 26.</em>
    <p>The remaining 12% of the prize fund is allocated to a reserve Booster Fund to
        ensure the minimum jackpot can always be paid. If the Booster Fund exceeds
        €20 million, any extra funds are diverted into the jackpot for the next draw.</p>
    <p>The underlying lottery is conducted on a pari-mutuel lottery basis, how much
        you win depends on the number of winning tickets in that same tier as well as
        the number of tickets sold in the particular underlying lottery draw.</p>
    <p>Only one prize per game can be won in each draw, if a game qualifies as a
        winner across more than one prize category than the highest prize will be paid
        to the winning player.</p>
