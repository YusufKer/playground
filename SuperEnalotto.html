    <p>The overall odds of winning a prize are 1 in 20.</p>
    <p>The ‘Jolly Number’ gives an additional chance to players who have matched five
        numbers, if they also match the ‘Jolly Number’ then they will move from the third
        division prize (5 numbers) to the second division prize (5 numbers plus Jolly
        Number). A player does not select a ‘Jolly Number’ when purchasing a ticket, this
        is an additional number drawn from the remaining 84 numbers left in the draw.</p>
    <p>The underlying lottery is conducted on a pari-mutuel lottery basis, how much
        you win depends on the number of winning tickets in that same tier as well as
        the number of tickets sold in the particular underlying lottery draw.</p>
    <p>Only one prize per game can be won in each draw, if a game qualifies as a
        winner across more than one prize category than the highest prize will be paid
        to the winning player.</p>

<div>
    <h3>Instant Win Prize</h3>
    <p>Instant win is a supplementary game which gives players another chance to win
