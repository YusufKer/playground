    SuperEnalotto Game Rules</h2>
    <p>Italy’s SuperEnalotto is one of the biggest lotteries in Europe. It is famous for its rollovers which grow the jackpots to hundreds of millions of Euros. There is no Jackpot cap until there is a winner, then the Jackpot reverts to the starting amount.  In August 2019 it set the European record for the biggest jackpot when it paid out a €209 million first prize to one lucky winner after jackpotting for over a year. There is a guaranteed minimum €2 million starting jackpot, with a percentage of ticket sales of previous draws being added to this until the jackpot is won. To play, 6 numbers are chosen out of a pool of 90. Draws take place in Italy at 8pm every Tuesday, Thursday and Saturday local time.
