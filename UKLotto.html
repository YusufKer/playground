    <em>The overall odds of winning a prize are 1 in 9.3.</em>
    <p>The underlying lottery is conducted on a pari-mutuel lottery basis, with the
        exception of the match 2 numbers prize (Prize Tier 6), how much you win
        depends on the number of winning tickets in that same tier as well as the
        number of tickets sold in the particular underlying lottery draw.</p>
    <p>The ‘Lotto Lucky Dip’ prize is for players who win the match 2 main numbers
        prize category (Prize Tier 6) will receive a free ‘Lucky Dip’ game in the next draw,
        a ‘Lucky Dip’ uses a ‘quick pick’ function to randomly select the numbers.</p>
    <p>Only one prize per game can be won in each draw, if a game qualifies as a
        winner across more than one prize category than the highest prize will be paid
        to the winning player.</p>
    <p>Prize capping takes place in very rare circumstances where popular number
        combinations are drawn, resulting in more winners than the operator of the
        underlying operator is able to pay for. In such cases the prizes won for matching
        3, 4, 5 or 6 main numbers or 5 numbers and the bonus ball (Prize Tiers 1 to 5)
        may be less than stated.</p>

        Thursdays and Sundays, Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST)</p>
</div>

<div>
    <h3>Jackpot Rollover</h3>
    <p>There is a jackpot cap on UK Lotto, jackpot rollovers are limited to five draws, on
        the fifth rollover that draw is declared a ‘Must Be Won Draw’ and the jackpot if
        not won is ‘rolled down’ and shared between all prize winners.</p>
    <p>In a ‘Must Be Won Draw’ where there is no jackpot winner, players who have a
        winning ticket in the Match 2 Prize Category (Prize Tier 6) will receive £5 in
        addition to the usual ‘Lotto Lucky Dip’ prize, the increase to the other prize
        categories are distributed in the following percentages:</p>
